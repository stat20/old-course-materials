$$\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

# The Linear Model

[What is it good for?]{.smalladage}


## The Linear Model: what is it good for?

1. _Description_: describing the linear relationship between the variables in the data set.

2. _Prediction_: predicting the unknown value of $y_i$ for a new $x_i$ not in the data set.

3. _Residual Analysis_: understanding the deviation of each observation, $y_i$, relative to the model's prediction, $\hat{y}_i$.

## Interpretation of $b_1$

. . .

The **slope** describes the estimated difference in the $y$ variable if the explanatory
variable $x$ for a case happened to be one unit larger.

. . .

```{r}
coef(m1)[2]
```

. . .

*For a state that is one point higher in the percentage of people living below the poverty level, we expect that state's proportion of high school graduates to be is 0.898 lower*.

> Be cautious. If it is observational data, you do not have evidence of a 
*causal link*, but of an association, which still can be used for prediction.


## Interpretation of $b_0$

. . .

The **intercept** is the predicted value that $y$ will take for a case with an $x$ value of zero.

. . .

```{r}
coef(m1)[1]
```

. . .

*For a state that has 0% of people living below the poverty level, we expect that state's proportion of high school graduates to be 96.2%*.

> Do we? While necessary for prediction, the intercept often has no meaningful interpretation.

## How good were the "predictions"?
 
. . .

$r^2$, the square of the correlation coefficient measures the proportion of total variability in the $y$ that is explained by the linear model.

. . .

- $r^2 \in [0, 1]$

- $r^2$ near 1 means predictions were more accurate.

- $r^2$ near 0 means predictions were less accurate.


## Two classes of predictions

1. _Interpolation_: Prediction using a value of $x$ that is _within_ the range of $x$ values found in the data set used to fit the model.

2. _Extrapolation_: Prediction using a value of $x$ that is _outside_ the range of $x$ values found in the data set used to fit the model.

## The Linear Model: what is it good for?

1. _Description_: describing the linear relationship between the variables in the data set.

2. _Prediction_: predicting the unknown value of $y_i$ for a new $x_i$ not in the data set.

3. _Residual Analysis_: understanding the deviation of each observation, $y_i$, relative to the model's prediction, $\hat{y}_i$.


## Residual Analysis

:::

A) $\hat{y}_i - \bar{y}_i$

B) $y_i - \bar{y}_i$

## Residual Analysis

. . .

A _residual_ is the difference between the observed value and the "predicted" value of a given $y_i$.

$$ e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i $$

. . .

Can be used to:

- Describe where a given observation lay relative to the model.
- Uncover more general trends in the interaction of the data and the model.


## Residual Analysis, cont.

Consider the case of Montana.

```{r echo = FALSE}

What to look for:

- Increasing or descreasing variance in the residuals (_heteroskedasticity_)

- Non-linear trends


## The Linear Model: what is it good for?

1. _Description_: describing the linear relationship between the variables in the data set.

2. _Prediction_: predicting the unknown value of $y_i$ for a new $x_i$ not in the data set.

3. _Residual Analysis_: understanding the deviation of each observation, $y_i$, relative to the model's prediction, $\hat{y}_i$.
