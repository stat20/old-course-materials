3. Lost iPad? Go to Stats Dept Office 3rd floor Evans


## Agenda

1. Making Generalizations

2. Example 1: Sampling the Class

3. Example 2: Spinning the Globe

## How can generalizations be wrong?

They can be based on small samples of data that may not be representative of the more general phenomenon

1. due to chance. This is called **sampling variability**, the variability in the data from one sample to the next.

2. due to a systematic **bias**, wherein *all* samples of data are persistently non-representative.


## Terminology around sets

1. **Population**: the full group of observational units upon which you wish to make a claim. Population size: $N$.

2. **Sample**: the set of observational units and accompanying data that you have observed. Sample size: $n$. $(n \le N)$

3. **Census**: a sample of data that encompasses the whole population. $n = N$.

4. **Anecdote**: a sample of size 1. $n = 1$.

## Probability distributions

A **probability distribution** of a discrete (random) data generating process encompasses all possible outcomes of a variable along with their respective probabilities.

They can be expressed as tables or bar charts.

**Properties**

1. The outcomes must be disjoint (mutually exclusive).
2. Each probability must be between 0 and 1.
3. The probabilities must sum to 1.


## Ex. of probability distributions

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
```{r fig.height=12}
library(tidyverse)
tibble(surface = c("Land", "Water"),
       p = c(.29, .71)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = surface,
             y = p)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Surface",
       y = "Probability") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 40)
```
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
```{r fig.height=12}
library(stat20data)
data(class_survey)
class_survey %>%
  mutate(year_at_cal = case_when(
    time_at_cal %in% c("This is my first semester!", "I'm in my first year.") ~ 1,
    time_at_cal == "I'm in my second year." ~ 2,
    time_at_cal == "I'm in my third year." ~ 3,
    time_at_cal == "I'm in my fourth year." ~ 4,
    time_at_cal == "More than 4 years." ~ 5
  )) %>%
  count(year_at_cal) %>%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_at_cal,
             y = p)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Years at Cal",
       y = "Probability") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 40)
```
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
```{r fig.height=12}
class_survey  %>%
  drop_na(season) %>%
  count(season) %>%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = season,
             y = p)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Season",
       y = "Probability") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 40)
```

### Generalization:

A description of the **process that generated** the data.


## Questions we seek to answer

1. How can we use a sample of *data* to reason about a particular *data generating process*?

2. How can we account for the uncertainty caused by *sampling variability*?

3. How does uncertainty decrease as we increase *sample size*?

4. How can we identify and deal with *statistical bias*?


## Looking Forward
